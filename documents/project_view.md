# Project Overview

The Used Car Price Intelligence dashboard is an end-to-end Power BI analytics solution designed to help users understand used-car pricing, market behaviour, and value.
It integrates star-schema modelling, Python ML predictions, DAX measures, and AI visuals to deliver actionable insights for buyers, sellers, and online automotive platforms.

The project demonstrates an advanced BI workflow combining:

Data preparation with Power Query

Star Schema fact/dimension modelling

Python Machine Learning integration

AI-driven analytics (Key Influencers, Decomposition Tree, Q&A)

Interactive visual storytelling

## Objective

To build a unified analytical system that answers key questions such as:

What factors influence used-car prices the most?

Which cars offer the best value for money?

How do fuel type, transmission, age, and mileage affect pricing?

Is a car overpriced, underpriced, or fairly priced?

How accurate are ML-predicted prices compared to actual market listings?

## What the Dashboard Delivers

Overview of the used-car market
Avg/Median price, age, mileage, fuel/transmission mix, brand distribution.

Buyer value intelligence
Price per KM, Price per Seat, Value Score (0–100).

Pricing driver analysis
What affects price?
– Age, fuel type, engine CC, transmission, km groups, brand, etc.
